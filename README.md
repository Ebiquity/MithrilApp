# Mithril app
### Also known as MithrilAC app
This is a multi purpose app. It will eventually merge into the main Mithril project.
Following are the goals of the app:
* Let users explore app installed on their phones.
* Let users uninstall apps from their phones.
* Let users check out details of an app. For example:
  * Result of [AndroidAnalytics](https://github.com/Ebiquity/AndroidAnalytics) project
  * App permissions requested
  * App permissions allowed
  * App API details if possible
* Let users send an app or mutiple apps for analysis to [AndroidAnalytics](https://github.com/Ebiquity/AndroidAnalytics) project
  * Users should be able to select single or multiple apps and send the same for analysis to the [AndroidAnalytics](https://github.com/Ebiquity/AndroidAnalytics) project.
